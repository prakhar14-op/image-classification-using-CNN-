 Cat & Dog Image Classification using CNN 🐱🐶
​This project is a classic computer vision problem that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either containing a cat or a dog. The model is built from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras.
​📝 Overview
​The goal of this project is to build an efficient and accurate image classifier. The CNN is trained on a dataset of thousands of cat and dog images to learn the distinguishing features of each animal. The project covers data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
​📂 Dataset
​The model was trained on the Dogs vs. Cats dataset, which was originally a Kaggle competition.
​Training Set: Contains thousands of images of cats and dogs for training the model.
​Test Set: Contains images for validating the model's performance.
​You can download the dataset from Kaggle: Dogs vs. Cats. You will need to structure the data into separate training_set and test_set directories, each with cats and dogs subdirectories.
